### Adding IDs for TOC Links
To ensure the TOC links work correctly, you can add explicit IDs to your headings if your Markdown renderer supports it. Here is an example:

```markdown
## <a id="demo"></a>Demo
## <a id="features"></a>Features
## <a id="installation"></a>Installation
## <a id="usage"></a>Usage
## <a id="customization"></a>Customization
## <a id="technologies-used"></a>Technologies Used
## <a id="license"></a>License
## <a id="acknowledgements"></a>Acknowledgements
```

Alternatively, if your Markdown renderer automatically generates IDs, you can use those IDs directly in your TOC links[2][4].
